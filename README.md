# Detect an object with OpenCV-Python
## _JKL404_


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. This Project focuses on detecting objects.
